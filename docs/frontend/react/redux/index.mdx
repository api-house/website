# Redux Toolkit (RTK)

Redux is designed to help you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. It provides a centralized store to manage the state of your entire application, making it easier to track state changes and debug issues.

## Objective
To create a movie list application using Vite, React, and Redux Toolkit. We will fetch data from our local server.

## Theoretical Foundation
Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of setting up a Redux store and managing state in a React application. It includes powerful tools like `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk` for writing reducers and handling asynchronous actions.

Redux has [three main principles](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/three-principles):
1. [**Single source of truth**](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/three-principles#single-source-of-truth) - The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
2. [**State is read-only**](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/three-principles#state-is-read-only) - The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
3. [**Changes are made with pure functions**](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/three-principles#changes-are-made-with-pure-functions) - To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
