# [Quick Start](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start#usage-summary)
In this guide, we will learn how to set up a Redux store in a React application using Redux Toolkit. Redux Toolkit is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. We will create a simple counter application that increments, decrements, and increments by a specific amount.

## Requirements

1. **Software:**
    - Node.js (LTS version recommended)
    - npm or yarn package manager
    - npm package `react`, `react-dom`, `react-redux`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`
2. **Knowledge:**
    - Basic JavaScript, React

## Integration Flow

## 1. Create a React Project
  First, we have to create a new project. We use Vite to do this. To create a new project, run the following command
  ```bash
  npm create vite@latest
  ```
  Then select the options as follows

    <figcaption>1.2 Client Application Setup</figcaption>
  </figure>

  Then install Redux and React Redux
  ```bash
  npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
  ```
  - [`@reduxjs/toolkit`](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. We need this to create a Redux store where the application's state will be stored and managed.
  - [`react-redux`](https://react-redux.js.org/)  is the official React binding for Redux. We need this to connect our React components to the Redux store because React components cannot access the store directly.

## 2. Create a Redux slice reducer with `createSlice`

  Add a new file named `src/features/counter/counterSlice.js`. In that file, import the `createSlice` API from Redux Toolkit.

  Creating a slice requires a string name to identify the slice, an initial state value, and one or more reducer functions to define how the state can be updated.
  Once a slice is created, we can export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function for the entire slice.

  Redux requires that [we write all state updates immutably, by making copies of data and updating the copies](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-2-concepts-data-flow#immutability).
  However, Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` and `createReducer` APIs use [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) to allow us to [write "mutating" update logic that becomes correct immutable updates](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-8-modern-redux#immutable-updates-with-immer).

  There are three main properties to define a slice:
  - `name`: A string name for the slice.
  - `initialState`: The initial state value for the slice.
  - `reducers`: An object with reducer functions to handle actions.

  ```js
  // src/features/counter/counterSlice.js

  import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

  export const counterSlice = createSlice({
    // name of the slice
    name: "counter",
    // initial state of the slice
    initialState: {
      value: 0,
    },
    // reducers to handle actions
    reducers: {
      increment: (state) => {
        // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
        // doesn't mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
        // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
        // immutable state based off those changes
        state.value += 1;
      },
      decrement: (state) => {
        state.value -= 1;
      },
      // To receive a payload, we write a reducer function that takes two arguments: the current state and the action payload
      incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
        state.value += action.payload;
      },
    },
  });
  ```
## 3. Export the action creators and the reducer.
  After we create a slice, we need to export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function.
  - `increment`, `decrement`, `incrementByAmount` are the action creators, we need them for updating the state later
  - `counterSlice.reducer` is the reducer function for the whole slice, we will bind this reducer to the store

  ```js
  // we used to named export the action creators for better import
  // so later in the component we can import them like this
  // import { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } from "./counterSlice.js";
  export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;

  // we export the reducer function to bind it to the store as default
  // so later in the store we can import it like this
  // import counterReducer from "./features/counter/counterSlice";
  export default counterSlice.reducer;
  ```
## 4. Create a Redux store with `configureStore` and add the slice reducer
  We need to import the reducer function from the counter-slice and add it to our store. By defining a field inside the `reducer` parameter, we tell the store to use this slice reducer function to handle all updates to that state. Reducer is what we export default in [above](#3-export-the-action-creators-and-the-reducer)
  ```js
  // src/store.js

  import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
  import counterReducer from "./features/counter/counterSlice";

  export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
      // assign the reducer to the store here
      counter: counterReducer,
    },
  });
  ```
You will see there is a property `counter` inside the `reducer` object. This means we can assign multiple slices here. By default, Redux doesn't use multiple reducers like this, but because we are using `@reduxjs/toolkit`, it is set by default to use [combineReducers](https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers).
## 5. Provide the Redux store to React
  Once the store is created, we can make it available to our React components by putting a React-Redux `<Provider />` around our application in `src/main.jsx`. Import the Redux store we just created, put a `<Provider />` around your `<App />`, and pass the store as a prop:
  - Put a React-Redux `<Provider>` component around your `<App />`
  - Pass the Redux store as `<Provider store={store}>`
    ```js
    // src/main.jsx

    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    import App from "./App";
    import { store } from "./store";
    import { Provider } from "react-redux";

    ReactDOM.render(
      // add React Redux Provider to react app
      <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
      </Provider>,
      document.getElementById("root")
    );
    ```
## 6. Use state and actions in React components
  Now we can use the React-Redux hooks to let React components interact with the Redux store. We can read data from the store with `useSelector`, and dispatch actions using `useDispatch`.
  - [`useSelector`](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#useselector) is a hook that takes a selector function as an argument. The selector is called with the entire Redux store state as its argument, and should return a value that the component needs.
  - [`useDispatch`](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#usedispatch) is a hook that returns a reference to the `dispatch` function from the Redux store. We can use it to dispatch actions to the store.

  :::info Remembers
  Always use `dispatch` to update the state, never update the state directly.
  :::

  ```js
  // src/App.jsx

  import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";

  import {
    increment,
    decrement,
    incrementByAmount,
  } from "./features/counter/counterSlice.js";

  export default function App() {
    // `store` is the global state variable
    // `counter` is the slice name, defined in step 4. inside reducer object
    // `value` is the state variable inside the counterSlice
    const counter = useSelector((store) => store.counter.value);

    // the `dispatch` method should take from `useDispatch` hook
    const dispatch = useDispatch();

    return (
      <div>
        <h4>Global Counter : {counter} </h4>
        {/* to dispatching an action, we can call the action creator */}
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>Decrement</button>
        {/* to send the argument to the reducer function just send via function params */}
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(incrementByAmount(2))}>
          Increment by 2
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  :::note
  We can only use all hooks inside `<App />` component, because only `<App />` component is wrapped by `<Provider />` component. [see here](#5-provide-the-redux-store-to-react)

## 7. Run the Application
  To run the application, execute the following command:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application running.
