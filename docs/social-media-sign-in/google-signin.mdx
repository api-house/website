# Google Sign In

## Objective
The objective is to create a web application that allows users to log in using their Google accounts, enhancing security and simplifying the login process. The backend will be built using Express and Sequelize to manage user data, while the frontend will use React for the web interface and NativeScript JS for mobile applications. The Google Sign-In (GSI) feature will be implemented by setting up a project in the Google API Console, including the necessary libraries, initializing the sign-in button, handling the sign-in response, and validating the token on the server. This approach ensures a consistent and secure authentication experience across different platforms, improving user retention and satisfaction.

## Theoretical Foundation
The implementation of Google Sign-In in web and mobile applications is grounded in several theoretical and academic principles that justify its use as an effective authentication method.
1. **Security and Trust**
   Google Sign-In leverages OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols, which are well-established frameworks for secure authorization and authentication. These protocols are widely accepted in the academic community for their robust security mechanisms, such as token-based authentication and encrypted data transmission, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and ensuring user data privacy.
2. **User Experience and Convenience**
   Theories in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) emphasize the importance of user experience and ease of use in software design. By integrating Google Sign-In, applications provide a familiar and straightforward authentication process, which aligns with the principles of usability and user-centered design. This reduces cognitive load and friction during the login process, thereby enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.
3. **Single Sign-On (SSO) Efficiency**
   Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. Academic research supports SSO as an efficient way to manage user identities, reducing the need for multiple passwords and simplifying access management. Google Sign-In, as an SSO solution, improves operational efficiency and security by centralizing authentication through a trusted provider.
4. **Scalability and Reliability**
   From a systems design perspective, using a third-party authentication provider like Google reduces the burden on developers to build and maintain secure authentication systems. This outsourcing to a scalable and reliable service aligns with principles of distributed systems and cloud computing, where leveraging established, high-availability services enhances the robustness and scalability of applications.
5. **Privacy and Data Protection**
   Google Sign-In adheres to stringent data protection regulations and standards, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act). By using Google’s authentication services, applications can ensure compliance with these regulations, which is critical for protecting user privacy and maintaining trust.
6. **Behavioral Economics and Trust Signals**
   In the realm of behavioral economics, trust signals play a crucial role in user decision-making. The Google brand is widely recognized and trusted, and integrating Google Sign-In serves as a trust signal to users, indicating that the application values security and reliability. This can lead to higher user adoption rates and increased trust in the application.

## Procedural Steps

### [Set Up Google OAuth in Google Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid)

:::info Result
After this step, you will obtain the OAuth 2.0 `client_id` and `client_secret` from the Google Developer Console. Save them to your .env file.
:::
1. First, obtain your `client_id`. [You can check the guide here](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid#get_your_google_api_client_id)
2. Open the **Credentials** page on the [Google Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).
3. If this is your first time using the Google Developer Console, create a new project.
4. On the `Enable APIs and Services` page, search for `Create Project`. It should appear in the top right corner.
    <figure>
      ![1.1 Create a new project in the Dashboard](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/create-project.png)
      <figcaption>1.1 Create a new project in the Dashboard</figcaption>
    </figure>
5. After you click `Create Project`, a popup will appear displaying a list of your projects.
6. Then, click the `New Project` button to create a new project.
    <figure>
      ![1.2 Creating a Project](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/new-project.png)
      <figcaption>1.2 Creating a Project</figcaption>
    </figure>
7. Enter the project name and click the `Create` button.
    <figure>
      ![1.3 New Project Configuration](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/new-project-configuration.png)
      <figcaption>1.3 New Project Configuration</figcaption>
    </figure>
      Here are the configuration details:
     - The first underline shows your remaining project quota. Once it reaches the limit, you will need to upgrade your account. If this is your first time, you will receive a free quota of 12 projects.
     - The second underline is for the `Project name`. Enter a name that aligns with your project’s purpose. **This name cannot be changed later, so choose carefully.**
     - For the organization field, you can leave it blank. Since we’re not using an organization, this project will be for public use.
     - Finally, click the `Create` button to create the project. The creation process will take a few seconds to complete.
8. After completing the configuration, you will be redirected to the project dashboard. The project name and ID will be displayed on the notification panel. Click `Select Project` to begin working on your project.
  <figure>
    ![1.4 Project Created](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/project-created.png)
    <figcaption>1.4 Project created</figcaption>
  </figure>
9. To confirm that you are using the correct project, check the underlined section in Figure 1.5, which displays the currently active project. Then, navigate to the `Credentials` menu and click the `Configure Consent Screen`.
  <figure>
    ![1.5 Begin setting up the OAuth consent screen.](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/start-consent-screen.png)
    <figcaption>1.5 Begin setting up the OAuth consent screen.</figcaption>
  </figure>
10. The OAuth consent screen on Google is part of the OAuth 2.0 authentication and authorization process, which allows third-party applications to access user data on behalf of the user. When an application requests access to a user's data, Google displays an OAuth consent screen, asking the user to grant or deny the permissions requested by the application.
    :::info Consent Screen
    Both `Sign In With Google` and `One Tap authentication` include a consent screen which tells users the application requesting access to their data, what kind of data they are asked for and the terms that apply.
    :::
    Inside the OAuth consent screen configuration, choose your target user type as `External`, because we want all users with a Google account to be able to use this app, and not be limited to an organization or team, for public accessibility. Then, click `Create`.
    <figure>
      ![1.6 OAuth Consent Screen User Type](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/consent-screen-config.png)
      <figcaption>1.6 OAuth Consent Screen User Type</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Then, on the OAuth consent screen configuration, enter the required fields:<br />
      - **Application Name <span className="required">(required)</span>**: The name of the application requesting consent. It should accurately reflect your application and be consistent with the name users see elsewhere.<br />
      - **Application Logo**: This image is displayed on the consent screen to help users recognize your app. The logo appears on the Sign In With Google consent screen and in account settings, but is not shown on the One Tap dialog.<br />
      - **Support Email <span className="required">(required)</span>**: Displayed on the consent screen for user support and visible to G Suite administrators evaluating access to your application for their users. This email address appears on the Sign In With Google consent screen when the user clicks the application name.<br />
    <figure>
      ![1.7 OAuth Consent Screen App Information](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/consent-screen-oauth.png)
      <figcaption>1.7 OAuth Consent Screen App Information</figcaption>
    </figure>
      - **Developer Contact Information <span className="required">(required)</span>**: This field is required for Google to notify the developer if there is a change in the application. <br />
    After filling in the required fields, click `Save and Continue`.
    <figure>
      ![1.8 OAuth Consent Screen App Information](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/consent-screen-oauth-2.png)
      <figcaption>1.8 OAuth Consent Screen App Information</figcaption>
    </figure>
      - **Scopes for Google APIs**: Scopes allow your application to access your users' private data. For authentication, the default scopes (email, profile, openid) are sufficient; you don't need to add any sensitive scopes. It is generally best practice to request scopes incrementally, at the time access is required, rather than upfront. Learn more.
    <figure>
      ![1.9 Consent Screen Scopes](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/consent-screen-add-scopes.png)
      <figcaption>1.9 Consent Screen Scopes</figcaption>
    </figure>
      - Google provides many scopes. For OAuth usage, we recommend enabling three scopes: `email`, `profile`, and `openid`. These scopes are used to access the user's email, profile, and unique identifier. You can add more scopes based on your application's requirements.
    <figure>
      ![1.10 Consent Screen Scopes Configuration](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/consent-screen-scopes-configuration.png)
      <figcaption>1.10 Consent Screen Scopes Configuration</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Then click `Save and Continue` After that, you will be asked to add Test Users; we can skip this step and click `Save and Continue` again. Finally, click `Back to Dashboard`.<br/>
    Finally, we have created our OAuth Consent Screen. Now, we can create the OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
11. To create our `client_id` Go to `Credentials` and click `Create Credential` > `OAuth client ID`.
    <figure>
      ![1.11 Create OAuth Client ID](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/create-credential.png)
      <figcaption>1.11 Create OAuth Client ID</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Inside the OAuth client ID configuration:
    - Set the **application type** to `Web application` because we are using Google Sign-In on the web.
    - Enter the name of your application.
    - For **Authorized JavaScript Origins**, specify where the Google scripts can be executed. We should add the client-side URL. For local tests or development, you must add two values here. First, add `http://localhost` and then `http://localhost:port`. Since we are using React Vite for our client-side app, the URL should be `http://localhost:5173`.
    - For **Authorized Redirect URIs**, leave the field blank because we are using the default Google button, not a custom button, so we don't need to set up a redirect URL.
    Then click `Create`.
    <figure>
    ![1.12 Create Credential OAuth client ID](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/credential-configuration.png)
      <figcaption>1.12 Create Credential OAuth client ID</figcaption>
    </figure>
    After that, you can see your `client_id` and `client_secret`. Copy them and save them to your `.env` file.
    <figure>
      ![1.13 Credential created](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/credential-created.png)
      <figcaption>1.13 Credential created</figcaption>
    </figure>

### [Set Up client-side using React](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/display-button#button_rendering)
:::info Result
After this step, you will have a Google Sign-In button on your React application that allows users to sign in using their Google account.
And the Google token will be sent to the server for further verification.
:::
1. Create a New React Project using Vite
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest
    ```
    <figure>
      ![2.0 Client Application Setup](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/client-application-setup.png)
      <figcaption>2.0 Client Application Setup</figcaption>
    </figure>
2. Then install required package and install `axios` for handling client request.
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    npm install axios # the package for handle client request
    ```
3. Then create `.env` file and add to the project root, and your project file now should be like this.
    <figure>
      ![2.1 Project structure](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/project-structure.png)
      <figcaption>2.1 Project structure</figcaption>
    </figure>
4. Inside the `.env` file, enter the Google `client_id` and `client_secret`.
    ```env
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=1014925070088-gjj0mtq0bo68kdfktq2fk7m5rcombv3n.apps.googleusercontent.com
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=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
    ```
5. To render the button on the client side, [navigate to the docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/display-button#button_rendering), where you will find code similar to this in the JavaScript section.
    ```html
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client" async=""></script>
        <script>
          function handleCredentialResponse(response) {
            console.log("Encoded JWT ID token: " + response.credential);
          }
          window.onload = function () {
            google.accounts.id.initialize({
              // Replace YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID with your own client_id obtained from step 1
              client_id: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
              // Callback function to handle the response
              callback: handleCredentialResponse,
            });
            google.accounts.id.renderButton(
              // Get the element where the button will be rendered; this must exist in the DOM
              document.getElementById("buttonDiv"),
              // Customize the Google button attributes
              { theme: "outline", size: "large" }
            );
            // Display the One Tap dialog; comment out to remove the dialog
            google.accounts.id.prompt();
          };
        </script>
        <div id="buttonDiv"></div>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```
6. Let's break this down step by step. First is the Google script tag `<script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client" async defer></script>`. This script loads the Google Sign-In functionality, including the `google.accounts.id` object. We need to place this script inside the `<head>` tag of our `index.html` file. This placement ensures the script is loaded as soon as the application is rendered.
7. Next, inside the `App.jsx` file, remove the boilerplate code and initialize the Google account ID within the `useEffect` hook. Placing the initialization inside `useEffect` ensures that the code runs only once, after the component has mounted and the Google script has loaded. We are use `axios` to handle the client request.
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
      // Initialize the Google Sign-In button
      google.accounts.id.initialize({
        // to load the env in Vite project
        // please navigate to this doc -> https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode
        client_id: import.meta.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
        // After the process is complete, the callback function will be called
        callback: async (response) => {
          console.log("Encoded JWT ID token: " + response.credential)

          // Here is the logic to send the credential to the server
          // You can use axios or fetch to send the credential to the server
          const { data } = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/auth/google', {
            googleToken: response.credential,
          });
          localStorage.setItem('access_token', data.access_token);

          // navigate to the home page or do magic stuff
        },
      });

      // Render the Google Sign-In button
      google.accounts.id.renderButton(
        // The ID of the HTML element where the button will be rendered
        document.getElementById("buttonDiv"),
        // Customize the button attributes
        { theme: "outline", size: "large" }
      );
      // Display the One Tap dialog; comment out to remove the dialog
      google.accounts.id.prompt();
    }, []);
    ```
    :::tip
    If above code shown an error in variable `google`, you can add a window before the `google` variable. So the code will be like this `window.google.accounts.id.initialize({ ... })`
    :::
8. Then, the component should render the button. Add the `<div id="buttonDiv"></div>` to the component's JSX.
9. The full code inside `index.html` should be look like this
    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <link href="/vite.svg" rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" />
        <meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" name="viewport" />
        <title>Vite + React</title>
        <!-- we add this line of code to load the gsi script -->
        <script async="" src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
        <script src="/src/main.jsx" type="module"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```
10. The full code inside `App.jsx` should be look like this
    ```jsx
    import { useEffect } from 'react';
    import axios from 'axios';

    function App() {
      useEffect(() => {
        google.accounts.id.initialize({
          // fill this with your own client ID
          client_id: import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
          // callback function to handle the response
          callback: async (response) => {
            console.log("Encoded JWT ID token: " + response.credential)
            const { data } = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/auth/google', {
              googleToken: response.credential,
            });

            localStorage.setItem('access_token', data.access_token);

            // navigate to the home page or do magic stuff
          },
        });
        google.accounts.id.renderButton(
          // HTML element ID where the button will be rendered
          // this should be existed in the DOM
          document.getElementById('buttonDiv'),
          // customization attributes
          { theme: 'outline', size: 'large' },
        );
        // to display the One Tap dialog, or comment to remove the dialog
        google.accounts.id.prompt();
      }, []);

      return <div id="buttonDiv"></div>;
    }

    export default App;
    ```
11. Run the client app by using
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
12. You will see the running port in the terminal, it should be like this
    <figure>
      ![2.2 Running Application](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/running-application.png)
      <figcaption>2.2 Running Application</figcaption>
    </figure>
13. Navigate to the url shown in the terminal, and you will see the Google Sign-In button.
    <figure>
      ![2.3 Button Google on Application](/social-media-sign-in/google/images/application-button-google.png)
      <figcaption>2.3 Button Google on Application</figcaption>

    ```
### [Verify the Google Token on the Server Side](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/verify-google-id-token#node.js)
1. **Create a New Express Project**.
   There are several packages to support our demo
   - **nodemon**: Used to auto-restart our server on save.
   - **cors**: For handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to receive our client-side requests.
   - **sequelize**: Our beloved ORM for handling communication to the database seamlessly.
   - **google-auth-library**: For handling the verification of `id_token` from Google once it's received.
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    npm install express cors sequelize pg pg-hstore jsonwebtoken google-auth-library
    npm install -D sequelize-cli nodemon dotenv
    ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```env
    PORT=3000
    JWT_SECRET=secret
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=1014925070088-gjj0mtq0bo68kdfktq2fk7m5rcombv3n.apps.googleusercontent.com
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=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
    ```
    This configuration requires package `dotenv` as devDependencies which is we installed in step 1 above.
3. Initialize Sequelize
    ```bash
    npx sequelize-cli init
    ```
   This will create a `config`, `migrations`, `models`, and `seeders` directory.
   Then update the `config/config.json` to use PostgreSQL.
    ```json
    {
      "development": {
        "username": "your_db_username",
        "password": "your_db_password",
        "database": "02-google-sign-in",
        "host": "localhost",
        "dialect": "postgres"
      }
    }
    ```
   Replace `your_db_username` and `your_db_password` with your own database username and password
4. Create a model to store our user
    ```bash
    npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name User --attributes name:string,email:string,password:string,picture:string,provider:string
    ```
    This will create a `models/user.js` file.
5. Instantiate the `OAuth2Client` from `google-auth-library`.
    ```js
    const { OAuth2Client } = require('google-auth-library');
    const client = new OAuth2Client();
    ```
6. Then we verify the token from the client-side in the server
    ```js
    // we receive googleToken from the client
    const { googleToken } = req.body;
    const ticket = await client.verifyIdToken({
      idToken: googleToken,
      // we use our client_id from the Google console
      audience: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
    });
    ```
7. Then we get data from the ticket and process our data to store it in our database. Logging in using social media doesn't require us to register first, but we can also log in the user as the authentication already uses OAuth 2.0.
   You can check the [payload data here](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/backend-auth#calling-the-tokeninfo-endpoint)
    ```js
    const payload = ticket.getPayload();
    const [user, created] = await User.findOrCreate({
      where: { email },
      defaults: {
        name: payload.name,
        email: payload.email,
        picture: payload.picture,
        provider: 'google',
        // We can type any password as a placeholder.
        // In future development, you should implement a feature to update the user's password.
        password: 'google_id'
      },
      // Required to set hooks: false
      hooks: false
    });
    ```
    :::warning

    Remember to add the option `hooks: false` to the model finder, because we are using bcryptjs to hash passwords, and it always fails when the user logs in using regular login.
    :::
8. After that, we create a token using `jsonwebtoken` for `access_token` to access our resource. It has a different purpose from the Google token. The Google token is the user token provided by Google that contains user information. We use that token to extract user information to insert into our database. The `access_token` we create is for accessing our website.
    ```js
    const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    // We conditionally respond with the status because the client needs to know
    // whether it is a new user or an existing user.
    res.status(created ? 201 : 200).json({ access_token: token });
    ```
9. Full code inside `app.js` and add the following code:
    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    const cors = require('cors');
    const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
    const axios = require('axios');
    require('dotenv').config();

    const {OAuth2Client} = require('google-auth-library');
    const client = new OAuth2Client();

    const { User } = require('./models');

    const app = express();
    app.use(cors());
    app.use(express.json());

    app.post('/auth/google', async (req, res) => {
      const { googleToken } = req.body;
      try {
        const ticket = await client.verifyIdToken({
          idToken: googleToken,
          audience: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
        });
        const payload = ticket.getPayload();
        const [user, created] = await User.findOrCreate({
          where: { email },
          defaults: {
            name: payload.name,
            email: payload.email,
            picture: payload.picture,
            provider: 'google',
            password: 'google_id'
          },
          hooks: false
        });

        const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        res.status(created ? 201 : 200).json({ access_token: token });
      } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal server error' });
      }
    });

    app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${process.env.PORT}`);
    });
   ```
10. Try to run the server by using
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

## Result
This setup allows users to authenticate using their Google account. Upon successful login, the user's information is stored in a PostgreSQL database managed by Sequelize.

## Common Mistakes
- **Invalid Client ID**: Double-check that your Client ID is correctly configured in both the backend and frontend.
- **CORS Issues**: Ensure that the backend API allows requests from the frontend's origin.
- **Database Connection Errors**: Verify your database connection settings and ensure the database server is running.
- **Popup Google Login is blank after deployment**: Make sure to add your new deployed URL to the Authorized JavaScript Origins in the Google Developer Console.
